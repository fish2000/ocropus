All the current OCRopus sources can be found in the ./ocropy subdirectory.
Install them with:

    cd ocropy
    sudo ./ocropus-install-packages
    cd models
    ./ocropus-download-models
    cd ..
    sudo python setup.py install
    ./run-test

Other subdirectories contain examples for training etc.:

  - fraktur-boxes: An example of training OCRopus models on the same box
    files that are used for Tesseract training.  This is a good way of
    getting OCRopus training started.

  - uw3-500: An example of running the recognizer on text lines and
    training OCRopus models with unaligned data.
