This example illustrates applying OCRopus to a small-print historical
newspaper, as well as adjusting the layout analysis parameters for
ocropus-gpageseg.

In general, for these kinds of inputs, you probably need to adjust parameters.
To obtain higher recognition rates, if you have a significant number of these
documents, it also makes sense to train a specific model (this sample run
just uses the generic model).
